# Granny's Kitchen - Foley Sounds Granular Synthesis
## CMLS - HW#1, Group 3: La Lobby

<p>
  The goal of the assignment was the creation of foley sounds by means of granular synthesis in the SuperCollider environment. The synthesis was implemented inside     an application provided with a GUI, in order to allow the user to partially customize the sounds via the synthesis parameters.
</p>
<p>
  The synthesis process started with the selection of the environment to which the
  synthesized sounds would belong. The choice fell on an ordinary life soundscape: the
  one of a kitchen.
